# LSTM-Options-Pricer-With-BSM-Comparison
## ℹ️ Overview 
This project uses a Black Scholes Model(BSM) to make a prediciton on a certain stock's option price. There was an issue with European Options data from yfinance library so settled for using the BSM to estimate the price of American options, ignoring the divided yield. 

Used an LSTM model to predict future stock price for the selected stock. This predicted price is then used in standard layoff formulae to predict a final price which compares well with the BSM prediction.

The project uses streamlit for user-friendly frontend.

## ✅Installation and Run
